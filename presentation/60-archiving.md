## Timing

:::: {.column}

Consider the following questions:

Once you have **collected** the data
- is it really going to change?

Once you have registered your analysis plan
- should the **processing and analysis** really change?

I don't want to be scooped!

Thus, I'm not going to publish my raw data just yet!

# What is preservation

## Preservation {.smaller}

::: {.columns-2}

:::: {.column}

- Preservation != publication, != sharing
- In fact, preservation may mean: not very accessible at all!
- Preservation is intended to maintain data for tens, even hundreds of years
  - Preservation may involve curation: active transformation of the data for improved accessibility

## What is publication


Publication typically involves making information about the data, as well as the data themselves, available to others.

- Publication can initially mean that only **metadata** (information about the data) is published
- In some cases, it may be that **only** metadata is ever published
- But the metadata will point to how to access the data, how long the data will be preserved, and other salient facts


## This all seems so complicated

- I need to preserve my data for decades!
- I need to manage the application process for decades!
- Where do I get that DOI thing?
- How to I get Google to index my data?



## Options for Preservation (1)


**Trusted Repositories**

Journals and institutions have assessed a number of trusted repositories:

- [CoreTrustSeal](https://www.coretrustseal.org/) has a certification process
- [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/) lists research data repositories
- [Nature](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories), [F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/for-authors/data-guidelines#hosting), and [PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability) have lists of trusted repositories. 
- Always check with your journal for specific restrictions or suggestions.

## Options for Preservation (2)

**Trusted Repositories**

- These generally include at least the following:

  -  [Dryad Digital Repository](http://datadryad.org/)
  -  [figshare](http://figshare.com/)
  -  [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu)
  -  [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/) and [OPENICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/)
  -  [Open Science Framework](http://osf.io/)
  -  [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/)
  - Country or region-specific repositories (that nevertheless generally accept depositors from anywhere): [GESIS](https://datorium.gesis.org/xmlui/) (Germany), [Swedish National Data Service (SND)](https://snd.gu.se/en/describe-and-deposit-data), [EASY](https://easy.dans.knaw.nl/ui/home) (Netherlands), [CSIRO](https://data.csiro.au/collections/) (Australia), etc.
- Many universities have formal document repositories that may be able to assume such a role; talk to your (data) librarian
