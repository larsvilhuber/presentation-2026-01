# What can **YOU** do?

## What is this?

## Training

- Biology students learn key lab techniques
  - Pipetting
  - Capture-recapture of wild animals

## **YOU**!

# (BTW...)

When I prompted Gemini to correct the spelling in "Reproducibility", it only made it worse!

## Verification by journals

- **Provision** (publication of materials) provides transparency
- **Verification** (running the analysis again - computational reproducibility) compensates for *mistrust*/*absence of trust*

## Which journals  {.smaller}

- [American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/) (8)
- [Econometric Society](https://www.econometricsociety.org/) (3)
- [Canadian Journal of Economics](https://www.economics.ca/cje-home) (1)
- [Royal Economic Society](https://res.org.uk/journals/) (2)
- [Western Economic Association International](https://weai.org/view/EI-Journal-Policies) (1)
- [European Economic Association](http://www.eeassoc.org/journal) (1)
- [Review of Economic Studies](https://www.restud.com/) (1)
- [Journal of the European Economic Association](https://academic.oup.com/jeea) (1)
- [Journal of Political Economy](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/jpe/about) (3)

## Taking it a step further

::: {.white-col}
![Survey flow](images/xkcd_data_provenance-5.png)
:::

## Taking it a step further

- Has been discussed by authors behind Data Colada
- Survey tool provider (Qualtrics, etc.) exports data, posts **checksum**
- Survey tool provider exports data only to institution directly into trusted repository, researchers obtain data from there (with privacy protections)
- Researcher can verify **checksum**

## Does not prevent all fraud

## Work in progress

- Working with [cascad](https://www.cascad.tech/), several [INEXDA](https://inexda.org) members, and others
- Relying on external certification of data inputs (data catalogs with metadata, checksums)

"No, of course, the British Prime Minister and Nobel Laureate for Literature never claimed such nonsense. But putting his name in front of a quote gives it a more solemn, more imposing, more definitive appearance." [[Source](https://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/fake-churchill-quote/)]
