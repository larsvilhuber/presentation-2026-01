"a scientific integrity committee found that the results in two of Smeesters’ papers were **statistically highly unlikely**. Smeesters *could not produce the raw data* behind the findings, and told the committee that he **cherry-picked** the data to produce a statistically significant result. Those two papers are being retracted, and the university accepted Smeesters’ *resignation* on June 21."

"MIT now declares “**no confidence in the provenance**, reliability or validity of the data and...in the veracity of the research”. Mr Toner-Rodgers’s paper has been *withdrawn* from the pre-print repository on which it first appeared [arXiv]; ... The lab at the heart of his findings remains **unknown**."

## Consider the case of Gino

## The case of Gino

- Francesca Gino was a *tenured* professor at Harvard Business School, writing on **honesty** (!)

## The case of Gino
