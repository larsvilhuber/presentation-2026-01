## So how can you verify my results?

- By obtaining the file again
- By running my code again
- By verifying that the results are the same!

#  **Trust but verify!**

- Reproducibility is key!
- But there are weaknesses...

## What if you could verify the file?

```{r checksum, include=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# compute checksum of the file
tools::md5sum(here::here("presentation","SP500.csv"))
```
- The checksum is a unique fingerprint of the file
- If the file changes, the checksum changes
