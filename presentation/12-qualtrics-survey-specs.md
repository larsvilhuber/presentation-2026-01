## Side-note: Survey definition from  Qualtrics

You should not forget to preserve your survey definition!

- Download a `qsf` file to save and transfer survey structure to have a backup survey template. Export as `.qsf` in `Tools` in Qualtrics.
- Can also export survey as Word doc in `Tools` in Qualtrics. Choose this option to get a well-formatted document.

## Side-note to side-note: Confidential data in survey definitions!

It is possible that your survey definition itself contains information that you are not allowed to publish:

---

- You might be running the survey with a firm, and the firm does not want to be identified
- You are asking questions about specific products, and the product names are confidential

> It is actually **hard** to de-identify a `qsf` file. We will not try to do this here, but you should be aware of this issue.
